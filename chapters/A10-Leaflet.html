<p>Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It is widely used across the web and is a great way to display location data. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use leaflet in R to create interactive maps.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> The data sets</h2>
<p>We will use Department for education progress 8 data to examine school performance in England. We will use two dats sets, one containing the location of schools and the other containing the progress 8 scores for each school.</p>

<p>The progress 8 refers to a value added measure used by the Department for Education in the UK to report the performance of secondary schools. It is calculated by comparing the progress of students from the end of primary school to the end of secondary school. Pupils are placed into bands by their performance at tests in English and mathematics during primary school (the KS2 SATS) and their progress is compared to the average progress of pupils with similar results.</p>
<p>When students sits national examinations at age 16 (GCSEs) their results in English and mathematics and six other subjects (sciences, computer science, geography, history, languages and three further subjects). English and mathematics are double weighted in the calculation of Progress 8. For each student an attainment 8 score is calculated, a measure of average attainment across the eight subjects.</p>
<p>Progress 8 is calculated by subtracting the average attainment 8 score of pupils in the school from the average attainment 8 score of pupils with the same prior attainment at the end of primary school. The difference is divided by ten to give a Progress 8 score. A school with a Progress 8 score of 0 is performing in line with the national average. A school with a positive Progress 8 score is performing better than the national average and a school with a negative Progress 8 score is performing worse than the national average.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Loading the data and merging the data sets</h2>
<p>The first step is to load the two data sets. Often in projects data may be spread across multiple sources - here the location data and the progress 8 data are in separate files. We will load the data and then merge the two data sets together.</p>
<p>We don’t need all the columns in the data sets, and will keep the following entries from the two data sets:</p>

<p>A common issue with geographical data is that the coordinates are often in a different from those used by mapping software. For example, the coordinates in the data set are in eastings and northings rather than latitude and longitude. We will use the <code>sp</code> package to convert the eastings and northings to latitude and longitude. The <code>sp</code> package is a popular package for working with spatial data in R.</p>
<p>First we use the <code>coordinates()</code> function in R, from by the <code>sp</code> package, which is used to assign or retrieve spatial coordinates for a dataset</p>

<p>Now that we have the data in the correct format, we can create an interactive map using the <code>leaflet</code> package in R.First, we will create a map that displays the location of schools in England. We will use the <code>leaflet()</code> function to create a new leaflet map object, and then add markers to the map using the <code>addMarkers()</code> function.</p>
<p>First let us just create a basic map around the Waterloo campus of KCL.</p>

<p>You can change the style of the map by adding different tile layers. For example, you can use the <code>addProviderTiles()</code> function to add a different tile layer to the map. The <code>addProviderTiles()</code> function allows you to add tiles from different providers. See options for tile styles <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/">here</a>. You can change the level of zoom in the <code>setView()</code> function.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> function to add markers to the map. The <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> function allows you to add circle markers to the map at specific locations. You can customize the markers by changing the color, size, and shape of the markers. You can also add popups to the markers to display additional information. Here we set the fill to the type of school.</p>
<p>We need to specify a palette for the fill. We can use the <code>colorFactor()</code> function from the <code>leaflet</code> package to create a color palette based on the <code>NFTYPE</code> variable in the data frame. The <code>colorFactor()</code> function creates a color palette based on the unique values in a variable. We can then use the <code>fillColor</code> argument in the <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> function to set the fill color based on the <code>NFTYPE</code> variable.</p>
<p>The <code>NFTYPE</code> variable can have the following values:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span class="fu">unique</span>(merged_data<span class="sc">$</span>NFTYPE)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code> [1] "Community school"                    
 [2] "Voluntary aided school"              
 [3] "Academy sponsor led mainstream"      
 [4] "Free school - Mainstream"            
 [5] "Community special school"            
 [6] "Academy - Converter mainstream"      
 [7] "Foundation school"

<p>We can follow a similar process to add the progess 8 data to the map. This time we will create a continuous colour scale to show variation in progress 8 score. First let us convert P8MEA to numeric and check its range:</p>

<p>We can now define a continuous colour palette using the <code>colorNumeric()</code> function from the <code>leaflet</code> package. The <code>colorNumeric()</code> function creates a continuous color palette based on a numeric variable. We can then use the <code>fillColor</code> argument in the <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> function to set the fill color based on the <code>P8MEA</code> variable. There are a number of options for the palette, in the <code>colorNumeric()</code> function see <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#colorbrewer">here</a> for a full list. Palettes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“YlGnBu”: Yellow to green to blue</li>
<li>“RdYlBu”: Red to yellow to blue (good for diverging data)</li>
<li>“Viridis”: A perceptually uniform color map (great for continuous data)</li>
<li>“Magma”: A perceptually uniform palette with darker tones</li>
<li>“Plasma”: Bright and perceptually uniform</li>
<li>“Inferno”: A bright, perceptually uniform palette</li>
</ul>
